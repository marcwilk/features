# TypeScript Fundamentals

This repository contains a set of small TypeScript examples that demonstrate core language features, typing patterns, and best practices. Each file focuses on a specific concept and is intended for learning, reference, and review rather than as a single application.

## Project Purpose

- Practice TypeScript syntax and type annotations
- Understand how TypeScript handles variables, functions, objects, and classes
- Learn when and why to use explicit type annotations
- Build a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced TypeScript topics

## File Overview

### types.ts

Demonstrates basic type inference and object creation, including:

- Working with Date objects
- Object literals
- Class definitions and instantiation
- How TypeScript infers types by default

### variables.ts

Covers variable declarations and type annotations, including:

- Primitive types (number, string, boolean, null, undefined)
- Arrays with typed elements
- Object literals with explicit typing
- Function type annotations
- Common scenarios where explicit annotations are necessary

### functions.ts

Shows different ways to define and type functions in TypeScript:

- Arrow functions
- Function declarations
- Anonymous functions
- Return type annotations
- Void return types
- Destructuring with type annotations in function parameters

### objects.ts

Focuses on typing objects and destructuring, including:

- Nested object structures
- Methods with typed parameters and return values
- Destructuring with explicit type annotations
- Working with deeply nested properties

### arrays.ts

Covers array-related TypeScript concepts such as:

- Typed arrays
- Arrays of objects
- Iteration and type inference
- Common patterns for working with collections in TypeScript

## Notes

- Each file is independent and can be reviewed on its own
- The code prioritizes clarity over production-level structure
- This repository serves as a reference while progressing through more advanced TypeScript topics
