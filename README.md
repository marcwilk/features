# TypeScript Fundamentals

This repository contains a collection of small, focused TypeScript examples that demonstrate core language features, type inference, and common typing patterns. Each file is intentionally scoped to a single concept and can be reviewed independently.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong mental model of TypeScript fundamentals before moving on to frameworks or production-scale applications.

---

## Purpose

- Practice TypeScript syntax and type annotations
- Understand how TypeScript infers types
- Learn when explicit typing improves safety and readability
- Explore common patterns and pitfalls
- Build confidence working with typed JavaScript code

---

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as a set of standalone `.ts` files.

Each file:

- Focuses on one core TypeScript concept
- Contains small, readable examples
- Demonstrates both correct usage and common mistakes
- Is meant for learning, reference, and interview prep

There is no single “entry point” or runnable application.

---

## Concepts Covered

Examples in this repository may include (but are not limited to):

- Type inference and explicit annotations
- Primitive types and variables
- Functions and return types
- Objects and structured data
- Arrays, tuples, and unions
- Interfaces and structural typing
- Destructuring and nested data
- Common TypeScript pitfalls and best practices

New files can be added at any time to explore additional concepts.

---

## How to Use This Repo

- Review individual files in isolation
- Experiment by modifying examples or introducing type errors
- Use the repo as a quick reference while learning or interviewing
- Extend the repository with new files as you learn more advanced topics

---

## Notes

- Code examples prioritize clarity over production-level architecture
- Some examples intentionally demonstrate incorrect or discouraged patterns to highlight why they should be avoided
- This repository is meant to grow over time alongside deeper TypeScript learning (generics, narrowing, classes, advanced types, frameworks, etc.)
